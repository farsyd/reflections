### Q1

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need
to do it?

When a repository is initialized using git init, a .git folder is created
in that directory. This folder probably contains all the information
git needs to keep track of changes moving forward.

If you don't initialize a repository, how in the world do you let
git come in and do its thing?


### Q2

How is the staging area different from the working directory
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

You can't commit from the working directory. Commits have to be
from the staging area.

You can choose which files you would like git to track by
only placing those particular files in the staging area for the
git commit.

Maybe like one commit only has certain files, and another commit
has certain other files. Then when you rollback to a certain 
commit, then you will only have those files?

Or maybe if there are some really large image or video files
that you know aren't going to change or even if they change,
text-based git won't be particularly useful, then no need to 
waste storage on tracking those huge files?
