### Q1
When would you want to use a remote repository
rather than keeping all your work local?

-When multiple developers are collaborating on
  project.
-When I'm working from different locations using
  different machines.
-When I want others to use my work or see
  the results of my work.
  
### Q2
Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?

I guess it's along the lines of why you'd prefer to 
do commits manually rather than have an auto-commit
feature. This way, the local code in your working 
directory doesn't get updated when you're in the 
middle of working on something very important.
Also, it allows you to view the commit history on 
GitHub and pull whatever you need.
